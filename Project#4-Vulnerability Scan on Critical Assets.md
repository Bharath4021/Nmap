# Project 4: Vulnerability Scan on Critical Assets
## Introduction
This project simulates a pre-patching vulnerability assessment on a legacy server. The goal is to proactively identify exploitable or misconfigured services before a scheduled patch cycle, enabling the security team to prioritize and mitigate risks effectively.To achieve this, I used Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool, along with specialized vulnerability detection scripts focused on three critical areas.By conducting these targeted scans, this project mirrors real-world practices that precede system patching windows. Identifying and documenting vulnerabilities in advance helps ensure that critical security risks are not overlooked during the remediation process.

## Objective
- Identify known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations on critical services (e.g., FTP, SSH).
- Document services that may be exploited prior to patching.
- Simulate real-world internal vulnerability assessment procedures.

## Lab Setup
- Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
- Target Machine: ubuntu (192.168.1.130)
- Virtualization: VirtualBox (Host-Only Adapter)
- Tools Used: Nmap with vulnerability scripts

## Nmap Scans

### Full Vulnerability Script Scan

*nmap -sV --script vuln 192.168.1.74*

The command initiates a service version detection scan across all open ports and then runs a wide range of built-in Nmap vulnerability detection scripts (--script vuln) against each identified service. These scripts check for publicly known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), insecure configurations, outdated software versions, and potential backdoors. The results help uncover critical weaknesses that attackers might exploit, enabling security teams to prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation before the upcoming patch cycle.

#### Scan Results 



**output summary:-** During the vulnerability scan against the target machine 192.168.1.130, it was found that port 22 (SSH) is open and running OpenSSH version 9.6p1 on Ubuntu Linux. The service appears to be vulnerable to multiple known exploits, many of which have high CVSS scores ranging from 8.1 to 10.0, indicating critical risk. Specific exploits related to this OpenSSH version have been publicly disclosed, with direct links available through platforms like GitHub Exploit, Packetstorm, and CVE databases. Among the notable vulnerabilities, CVE-2024-6387 is highlighted, with a severity score of 8.1. The scan detected over 30 individual exploits associated with this service, suggesting that the SSH service could be a significant attack vector if not properly secured or patched. Immediate attention is recommended to mitigate these vulnerabilities, such as updating OpenSSH to a secured version or applying necessary security controls.


### FTP Vulnerability Enumeration

*nmap --script ftp-anon,ftp-vsftpd-backdoor -p 21 192.168.1.130*

This command specifically targets the FTP service running on port 21. It uses two Nmap scripts: ftp-anon to check if anonymous login is allowed without authentication (which can lead to unauthorized file access) and ftp-vsftpd-backdoor to detect if the server is vulnerable to the well-known backdoor present in vulnerable versions of vsftpd (2.3.4), which could allow remote attackers to gain unauthorized shell access. Identifying these vulnerabilities early is critical to preventing unauthorized access and remote code execution.

#### Scan Results 


**Output Summary:-** So, what I did was run an Nmap scan on two IP addresses (192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.130) specifically targeting port 21, which is commonly used for FTP services. I used two Nmap scripts—ftp-anon to check if anonymous access was allowed and ftp-vsftpd-backdoor to see if there was any backdoor vulnerability in the FTP service. The scan results showed that port 21 was closed on both devices, meaning there was no active FTP service running on them. Both devices were online and identified by their MAC addresses, but no vulnerabilities were found because the FTP service wasn’t available.




### SSH Enumeration

*nmap --script ssh2-enum-algos -p 22 192.168.1.130*

The ssh2-enum-algos script is used to enumerate the supported algorithms of the SSH service running on port 22. This includes identifying the encryption ciphers, key exchange methods, and MAC (Message Authentication Code) algorithms supported by the SSH server. By checking these algorithms, it helps to identify weak or outdated encryption methods that could be exploited by attackers to decrypt or tamper with communication. For example, older algorithms like DES or weak key exchange methods can be vulnerable to brute-force or man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Detecting such weaknesses allows for better securing of the SSH service by enforcing stronger cryptographic standards.




#### Scan Results



## conclusion 

This vulnerability scan on the legacy server successfully identified several critical areas that require immediate attention. The SSH service running OpenSSH version 9.6p1 was found to have multiple high-risk vulnerabilities, including CVE-2024-6387, which demands urgent remediation. Although no issues were found with the FTP service, the scan revealed potential misconfigurations in SSH that could be exploited. By proactively conducting this scan before the patch cycle, we can prioritize vulnerabilities and mitigate risks effectively, ensuring that the system is secured and protected from potential threats before any scheduled updates or changes are made.
