# Nmap
**Nmap is a network scanning tool used to Discover hosts (devices) on a network, Scan open ports (communication endpoints), Identify services and their versions (e.g., Apache, OpenSSH, MySQL), Determine the OS running on a device (e.g., Windows, Linux), Run scripts for scanning for vulnerability using its powerful NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine).**
# How does Nmap work?
Nmap sends crafted packets (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.) to a target and analyzes the response behavior to infer information about the host and services.
